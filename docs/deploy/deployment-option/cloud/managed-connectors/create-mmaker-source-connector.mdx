You can use a MirrorMaker2 Source connector to import messages from another Kafka cluster.
You can also use it to:

- Replicate messages from an external Kafka or Redpanda cluster.
- Create topics on the local cluster, with a configuration matching external topics.
- Replicate topic access-control lists (ACLs).

## Prerequisites

- The external Kafka cluster must be accessible.
- A service account with full access to the external cluster must be available.
  You can also use a service account with read-only ACLs when the `Offset-Syncs`
  topic location is set to `target`. You must have describe and/or describe-configs ACLs for
  the connector to read topic configurations on the source cluster and create the topics
  on the target cluster, unless you create the topics yourself.

## Limitations

- ACLs are copied, but service accounts are not created.
- Only topic ACLs are copied (group ACLs are not).
- Only ACLs for topics matching the connector configuration are copied (write ACLs are not copied).
- All permissions ACLs are downgraded to read-only.

## Create a MirrorMaker2 Source connector

To create the MirrorMaker2 Source connector:

1. In Redpanda Cloud, click **Connectors** in the navigation menu, and then
   click **Create Connector**.
2. Select **Import from Kafka cluster topics**.
3. On the **Create Connector** page, specify the following required connector
   configuration options:

   | Property                             | Description |
   | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
   | `Topics to replicate`  | Comma-separated topic names and regexes you want to replicate. |
   | `Source cluster broker list`  | A comma-separated list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers regardless of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping. This list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers, and should be in the form `host1:port1,host2:port2,...`. Because these servers are only used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), it need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down). |
   | `Source cluster security protocol` | The protocol to use to communicate with source brokers. Default is `PLAINTEXT`. |
   | `Sync topic configs enabled` | Specifies whether to periodically configure remote topics to match their corresponding upstream topics. |
   | `Sync topic ACLs enabled` | Specifies whether or not to periodically configure remote topic ACLs to match their corresponding upstream topics. |
   | `Connector name` | Globally-unique name to use for this connector. |
4. Click **Next**. Review the connector properties specified, then click **Create**.

## Map data

The value converter does not require any schema; it copies data as bytes.

## Test the connection

After the connector is created:

- Ensure that there are no errors in logs and in Redpanda Console.
- Confirm that Redpanda topics are being replicated. You should see messages coming into the topics.

## Troubleshoot

Most MirrorMaker2 Source connector issues are reported as a failed task at the
time of creation.

| Message | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Connection to node -1 (/127.0.0.1:9092) could not be established. Broker may not be available. / LOGS: Timed out while checking for or creating topic 'mm2-offset-syncs.target.internal'. This could indicate a connectivity issue / TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for a node assignment** | Make sure broker URLs are correct and that the `security.protocol` is correct. |
| **SaslAuthenticationException: SASL authentication failed: security: Invalid credentials** | Confirm that the username and password specified are correct. |
| **Terminated during authentication. This may happen due to any of the following reasons: (1) Authentication failed due to invalid credentials with brokers older than 1.0.0, (2) Firewall blocking Kafka TLS traffic (eg it may only allow HTTPS traffic), (3) Transient network issue** | Error indicates that the SSL should be enabled using `Source cluster security protocol` (use `SSL` or `SASL_SSL`). |
| **RecordTooLargeException: The message is N bytes (...)** | Use `producer.override.max.request.size` property to change max request size. |
| **RecordTooLargeException: The request included (...)** | The target server is not able to receive message because it is too large in size. Disabled compression can be a root cause. Consider enabling compression: `"Compression type": "snappy",` |
| **Scheduler for MirrorSourceConnector caught exception in scheduled task: syncing topic ACLs** | MirrorMaker2 requires an authorizer to be configured by the broker side, but it is not. Change the `Sync topic ACLs enabled` MirrorMaker2 property to `false` (default is `true`) to disable ACL syncing. |
| **TopicAuthorizationException: Topic authorization failed** | Confirm the service account for the source cluster contains describe and/or describe-configs ACLs. |
