Redpanda Connectors provide a way to integrate your Redpanda data with different
data systems. As managed solutions, connectors offer a simpler way to integrate
your data than manually creating a solution with the Kafka API. You can set up
and manage these connectors in Redpanda Console. All connectors are managed by
Redpanda.

Each connector is either a source or a sink:

- A source connector imports data from a source system into a Redpanda cluster.
  The source could be a cloud storage system such as S3 or GCS. The source connector's
  main task is to fetch data from these sources and convert them into a format
  suitable for Redpanda.

- A sink connector exports data from a Redpanda cluster and pushes it into a
  target system. The target could be a cloud storage system such as S3 or GCS.
  Sink connectors read the data from Redpanda and transform it into a format
  that the target system can use.

These sources and sinks work together to create a data pipeline that can move and transform data from one system to another.
